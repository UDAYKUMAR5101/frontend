# Install on a New Device

This project uses Node, Vite, React, and React Router. Follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or newer (20+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node)

## One-line install
Run this in the `suk` folder:

```
npm ci && npm run dev
```

`npm ci` installs the exact dependency versions from `package-lock.json` for reproducible builds, then `npm run dev` starts Vite.

## Manual install (if you need to update or add deps)
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Vite)
- `npm run build` — build for production
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
